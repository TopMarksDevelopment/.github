# Top Marks Development

Building open‑source tools that make developers faster, workflows cleaner, and projects more maintainable.  
Top Marks Development curates a small but growing collection of focused, reliable packages designed to solve real problems with minimal fuss.

Our philosophy is simple: **practical tools, clean code, zero noise.**

- **Modern, maintainable packages** — built with clarity, stability, and long‑term support in mind  
- **Open‑source first** — transparent development, community‑driven improvements, and permissive licensing  
- **Quality over quantity** — every project exists because it solves a need
